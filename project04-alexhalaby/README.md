# Final Project - Open Season

What do we need to know about interacting with your piece?

Start by clicking anywhere on the screen to start the oscillators and typing r to start the background track
To explore the sound space of the piece, position your hands at the center of the screen with your index fingers and thumbs together
Slowly open your finger and thumb on one hand to hear a synth. Now try the other hand.
Now, fill in the sound space by bringing your hands apart. This increases the volume of the back track. 
To change the note of the oscillators, move a specific hand up and down the y axis. The screen is broken by horizontal lines. There are five possible notes (pentatonic scale)


What was your inspiration or concept?

It started with a questions - How can I turn the body into an aurally satisfying and easy-to-play instrument?
The instrument needed to be simple enough to learn with minimal experimentation/practice, and there needs to be a visual component that responds to the user's actions. 
I experimented with chords and scales and found that the pentatonic scale would create the most simple, fool-proof, harmonic space.
I wanted the user to have a sense of visual feedback, which is where particles came in. 


What techniques did you use and why did you chose them?

I used perlin noise for the background, because the lines it generates mimics sound waves.
I implemented particle physics to create a visual component to the oscillator's sound, because the effect flows and expands like an open mouth makes the user feel like a wizard, casting sonic spells. 
I used a graphics context to create the background, for simplicity. 

Any references to tutorials, examples, libraries, inspirations etc that played a role in your piece
