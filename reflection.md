- Do you think it is complete?

I'm very happy with it. I think I can consider it complete, while accepting that art is always a work in progress. 

- If not, what would you still like to add or change?

Maybe different sound spaces all together, and a tutorial at the beginning for how to use it. 

- What part are you most proud of?

It's a rare assignment for me, where I started it early, and worked through a ton of iterations and ideas over the course of weeks.  When I show it off to someone new, their eyes always light up, and they get lost playing with the piece. I think what I'm proudest of is that it connects with people. 


- What part are you least proud of?

The background is too jittery and reactive.  

- What was the hardest part?

Getting to a place of audio-visual cohesion.

- What, if anything, have you gained by completing this project?

Confidence in my artistic capabilities!
